# Car-Automatic-Transmission
descriptionDesigned an automated gear system simulator for a car which would offer various features as follows:

- Increase the speed of the car by a certain fixed amount
- Decrease the speed of the car by a certain fixed amount
- Increase the gear of the car by one
- Decrease the gear of the car by one
- Report the status of the vehicle 

The application would initially store the various ranges of gears and based on the transmission operation performed on the vehicle, it would give out the status. This application would be viewed as a "gear-speed control mechanism" which is algorithmic in nature.
